# 🚨 CRITICAL CALENDAR DATE BUG FIX: July 31, 2025 Misalignment

## 🔍 Issue Description

**Bug**: On the live Sherbet site, the calendar in the listing availability editor was incorrectly showing Friday, July 31, when Thursday, July 31 is the correct date in 2025. The calendar was misaligned by one day, which could cause bookings to be inaccurate.

**Root Cause**: The calendar grid calculation in `MonthlyCalendar.js` was hardcoded to assume Sunday-first week, but the application uses Monday-first week (`firstDayOfWeek: 1`).

## 🛠️ Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The calendar grid calculation was using this logic:
```javascript
// OLD (BUGGY) CALCULATION
const allDays = eachDayOfInterval({
  start: new Date(monthStart.getFullYear(), monthStart.getMonth(), 1 - getDay(monthStart)),
  end: new Date(monthEnd.getFullYear(), monthEnd.getMonth() + 1, 7 - getDay(monthEnd)),
});
```

**Issues:**
1. **Hardcoded Sunday-first logic**: `1 - getDay(monthStart)` assumes Sunday is day 0
2. **Ignores `firstDayOfWeek` parameter**: The calculation doesn't respect the configured first day of week
3. **Inconsistent with application settings**: The app uses `firstDayOfWeek: 1` (Monday-first)

### July 2025 Specific Example

- **July 1, 2025**: Tuesday (getDay() = 2)
- **Old calculation**: `1 - 2 = -1` → June 30, 2025 (Monday) ❌
- **Expected**: Should start with Monday, June 30, 2025 ✅
- **July 31, 2025**: Thursday (getDay() = 4)
- **Old calendar**: July 31 appeared under Friday column ❌
- **Fixed calendar**: July 31 appears under Thursday column ✅

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fixed Calendar Grid Calculation

```javascript
// NEW (FIXED) CALCULATION
const daysToSubtractFromStart = (getDay(monthStart) - firstDayOfWeek + 7) % 7;
const calendarStart = new Date(monthStart.getFullYear(), monthStart.getMonth(), 1 - daysToSubtractFromStart);

const daysToAddToEnd = (7 - getDay(monthEnd) + firstDayOfWeek - 1) % 7;
const calendarEnd = new Date(monthEnd.getFullYear(), monthEnd.getMonth(), monthEnd.getDate() + daysToAddToEnd);

const allDays = eachDayOfInterval({
  start: calendarStart,
  end: calendarEnd,
});
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Respects `firstDayOfWeek` parameter**: Uses the configured first day of week
2. **Proper day calculation**: `(getDay(monthStart) - firstDayOfWeek + 7) % 7` correctly calculates days to subtract
3. **Consistent week completion**: Properly calculates days to add at the end
4. **Debug logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

- ✅ **July 2025 (reported bug)**: Fixed
- ✅ **All months in 2025**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Edge cases**: February (28 days), December (year boundary)
- ✅ **Different firstDayOfWeek values**: Sunday-first and Monday-first
- ✅ **July 31, 2025**: Now correctly appears under Thursday

   - Improved date range calculation

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ July 31, 2025 appeared under Friday
- ❌ Calendar misaligned by one day
- ❌ Potential booking inaccuracies
- ❌ Inconsistent with application settings

### After Fix
- ✅ July 31, 2025 correctly appears under Thursday
- ✅ Calendar properly aligned for all months
- ✅ Consistent with `firstDayOfWeek: 1` setting
- ✅ All date pickers work correctly
- ✅ No impact on booking calendar or transaction flows

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Formula Explanation

**Start Date Calculation:**
```javascript
const daysToSubtractFromStart = (getDay(monthStart) - firstDayOfWeek + 7) % 7;
```

- `getDay(monthStart)`: Day of week for month start (0-6)
- `firstDayOfWeek`: Configured first day (1 for Monday)
- `+ 7`: Ensures positive result
- `% 7`: Normalizes to 0-6 range

**End Date Calculation:**
```javascript
const daysToAddToEnd = (7 - getDay(monthEnd) + firstDayOfWeek - 1) % 7;
```

- Ensures the calendar ends on the correct day of week
- Completes the week properly

### Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Input parameters (month, firstDayOfWeek)
- Calculation steps (days to subtract/add)
- Result dates (calendar start/end)
- Generated calendar days count

## 🚀 Deployment

This fix has been implemented in the test branch and is ready for deployment. The changes:

1. **Backward compatible**: Works with existing data
2. **No breaking changes**: Maintains existing API
3. **Comprehensive testing**: Validated across all months
4. **Debug support**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

## 📝 Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use `firstDayOfWeek` parameter**: Never hardcode Sunday-first logic
2. **Test with different months**: Verify edge cases (February, December)
3. **Validate day alignment**: Ensure dates appear under correct weekdays
4. **Add automated tests**: Include calendar grid tests in CI/CD
