Fix duplicate tx declaration causing Render crash

- Remove duplicate const tx declaration at line 1760 in transition-privileged.js
- tx already declared at line 1733 in same scope (accept handler)
- Fixes SyntaxError: Identifier 'tx' has already been declared
- Introduced during SMS link shortening implementation
- No logic changes, only removes redundant redeclaration
- Server now starts successfully without syntax errors

Files changed:
- server/api/transition-privileged.js

Verification:
- node -e "require('./server/api/transition-privileged.js')" ✅
- npm run lint ✅
- Remaining tx declarations: 2 (both in separate scopes)

Impact: None - tx variable already had correct value from line 1733
