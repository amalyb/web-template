# TDZ Production Fix - Testing Instructions

## ‚úÖ Changes Complete

All changes have been successfully implemented and the production build is ready for testing.

## What Was Fixed

**Root Cause**: The minifier was creating variable name collisions between the global `process` object and a local `process` variable, causing a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) error in production builds:
```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'ot' before initialization at CheckoutPageWithPayment.js:789:27
```

**Solution**: Systematically renamed all local `process` variables to `txProcess` across the checkout flow to eliminate global shadowing.

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageWithPayment.js` - 7 renames
2. ‚úÖ `src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageTransactionHelpers.js` - 11 renames
3. ‚úÖ `src/containers/CheckoutPage/ShippingDetails/ShippingDetails.js` - Barrel import fix

## Build Status

‚úÖ **Production build successful**
```bash
npm run build
# Compiled successfully.
```

‚úÖ **No linter errors**
```bash
# 0 errors found
```

‚úÖ **Production server running**
```bash
# Server running on http://localhost:5001
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Manual Browser Test (CRITICAL)

The production build is currently serving at **http://localhost:5001**

**Steps to test:**
1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:5001`
2. Navigate to a listing page
3. Select dates and click "Book"
4. Go through the checkout flow
5. **Watch the browser console** for the TDZ error:
   - ‚ùå Before: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'ot' before initialization`
   - ‚úÖ After: No TDZ error should appear

### 2. Check Console Logs

Look for these debug logs (should appear without errors):
```javascript
üö® orderData in CheckoutPage.js: {bookingDates: {...}, ...}
‚úÖ [Checkout] üöÄ initiating once for [session-key]
‚úÖ [Checkout] Normalized dates: {startISO: "...", endISO: "..."}
```

### 3. Test Checkout Flow End-to-End

- [ ] Can access checkout page
- [ ] Booking dates display correctly
- [ ] Order breakdown calculates properly
- [ ] Stripe payment form loads
- [ ] Can fill in customer information
- [ ] Can complete checkout (or get to payment step)

### 4. Stop the Production Server

When testing is complete:
```bash
# Find the process ID
ps aux | grep "serve.*5001" | grep -v grep

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill 23276

# Or kill all serve processes
pkill -f "serve.*build"
```

---

## Verification Checklist

Before deploying to staging/production:

- [ ] Manual test: Checkout page loads without TDZ error
- [ ] Manual test: Can select dates and navigate to checkout
- [ ] Manual test: Order breakdown displays correctly
- [ ] Manual test: Stripe form initializes properly
- [ ] Manual test: Can submit checkout form
- [ ] Browser console: No "Cannot access 'ot' before initialization" errors
- [ ] Browser console: All debug logs appear as expected

---

## Additional Verification Commands

### Check for remaining `process` shadowing:
```bash
# Search for any remaining process variable declarations in checkout code
grep -rn "const process = " src/containers/CheckoutPage/
grep -rn "let process = " src/containers/CheckoutPage/
grep -rn "function.*process[,)]" src/containers/CheckoutPage/

# Should return 0 results (except comments)
```

### Check circular dependencies:
```bash
npx madge src --circular | grep -E "CheckoutPage"
# Existing circular dependencies through components barrel remain
# but are bypassed by direct imports
```

### Rebuild from clean state:
```bash
rm -rf build node_modules/.cache
npm run build
```

---

## Deployment Steps

Once testing is successful:

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageWithPayment.js
git add src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageTransactionHelpers.js
git add src/containers/CheckoutPage/ShippingDetails/ShippingDetails.js
git commit -m "Fix TDZ error by renaming process to txProcess

- Rename all local 'process' variables to 'txProcess' to eliminate global shadowing
- Add null-safe access for txProcess.transitions
- Replace barrel import in ShippingDetails with direct imports
- Prevents production minifier from creating TDZ errors via name collision

Fixes: 'Cannot access ot before initialization' at CheckoutPageWithPayment.js:789"
```

### 2. Deploy to Staging
```bash
git push origin main
# Wait for staging deployment
# Test checkout flow on staging
```

### 3. Monitor Production
After deploying to production:
- Monitor error tracking for TDZ errors
- Check that checkout completion rate doesn't drop
- Verify no new errors appear in logs

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Investigation
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Review server logs for API errors
3. Test in production build locally again
4. Report findings before re-deploying
