✅ Backwards compatible with old API format
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Early Return Removed** (Primary Fix)
**File:** `CheckoutPageWithPayment.js` lines 1284-1289

The checkout page had a hard gate that prevented rendering when `orderResult.ok === false`. This blocked the form from ever appearing. **Removed completely** - page now renders unconditionally.

---

### 2. **Address Field Flow Verified** (No Changes Needed)
**Files:** `StripePaymentForm.js`, `CheckoutPageWithPayment.js`

The data flow was ALREADY CORRECT but blocked by the render gate:

#### Speculation Flow (page load):
- Form values → `onFormValuesChange` → parent stores in ref → merged into speculation `protectedData`
- **Result:** Some fields may be `false` in logs (user hasn't filled form yet) - this is OK

#### Final Submit Flow (user clicks button):
- Form values → `handleSubmit` → extract `formValues.customer*` → build `protectedData` → include in `orderParams`
- **Result:** ALL fields MUST be `true` in logs - or booking will fail

**Key logging to watch:**
```bash
[checkout→request-payment] Customer fields in request: 7/7 [...]
[initiate] presence check { hasStreet: true, hasZip: true, hasPhone: true, ... }
```

---

### 3. **Line Items API Enhanced** (Backwards Compatible)
**Files:** `transaction-line-items.js`, `ListingPage.duck.js`

#### Server API Response
**Before:** `{ data: [...] }`
**After:** `{ lineItems: [...], breakdownData: {...}, bookingDates: {...} }`

#### Duck Thunk (lines 650-653)
Added smart detection:
```js
const data = response.data;
const payload = data.lineItems ? data : { lineItems: data };
```
**Result:** Handles BOTH old and new formats - no breaking changes

#### Reducer (line 202)
Already has fallback: `payload.lineItems || payload`
**Result:** Works with both formats

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Pre-Deploy Checklist
- [x] Build succeeds
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Backwards compatible with old API format
- [x] Data flow verified for BOTH speculation AND final submit
- [x] Logging added for debugging
- [x] Documentation complete

### Deploy Steps
```bash
# 1. Add all changed files
git add src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageWithPayment.js
git add src/containers/CheckoutPage/StripePaymentForm/StripePaymentForm.js
git add server/api/transaction-line-items.js
git add server/api/initiate-privileged.js
git add src/containers/ListingPage/ListingPage.duck.js

# 2. Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "fix: unblock checkout render and stabilize booking flow

- Remove early return blocking page render when orderParams invalid
- Enhance line-items API to return breakdownData and bookingDates
- Fix thunk to handle both old and new API response formats
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging data flow
- Verify address fields flow correctly on final submit

Fixes: checkout 'Payment temporarily unavailable' issue"

# 3. Push to deploy
git push origin main
```

### Post-Deploy Testing

#### Test 1: Page Renders
1. Navigate to any listing
2. Select dates and click "Request to book"
3. ✅ **Expected:** Page renders with form visible (no "Cannot render" error)

#### Test 2: Form Data Flows
1. Fill in billing address fields
2. Check console for: `[StripePaymentForm] mapped -> ['customerName', ...]`
3. ✅ **Expected:** Logs show all 7 customer fields

#### Test 3: Speculation Succeeds
1. Wait for page to finish loading
2. Check console for: `[SPECULATE_SUCCESS] { txId: '...', lineItems: 3 }`
3. ✅ **Expected:** Breakdown appears on right side with pricing

#### Test 4: Final Submit Works
1. Complete all form fields
2. Click "Complete booking"
3. Check server logs for: `[initiate] presence check { hasStreet: true, hasZip: true, ... }`
4. ✅ **Expected:** ALL presence flags are `true`, booking completes successfully

---

## 🔍 What to Watch in Production Logs

### Good Signs ✅
```
[Checkout] rendering regardless of orderResult.ok
[SPECULATE_SUCCESS] { txId: '...', lineItems: 3 }
[StripePaymentForm] mapped -> ['customerName', 'customerStreet', ...]
[checkout→request-payment] Customer fields in request: 7/7
[initiate] presence check { hasStreet: true, hasZip: true, hasPhone: true, hasEmail: true, hasName: true }
```

### Warnings to Ignore ⚠️
- Source map 404s - non-blocking
- Mapbox token warnings - non-blocking for checkout
- `[initiate] presence check { hasStreet: false, ... }` during speculation (before user fills form) - OK

### Red Flags 🚨
- Page still shows "Cannot render" - did server restart after deploy?
- Submit logs show `hasStreet: false` or `hasZip: false` - data flow broken
- No `[SPECULATE_SUCCESS]` log - speculation failed
- No breakdown on right side - line items API broken

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Fix Works
The root cause was a **premature optimization** - the early return tried to prevent render until all data was ready, but this created a catch-22:
- Can't render form → can't collect address data → can't complete orderParams → can't render form

By removing the gate, we allow the natural flow:
1. Page renders with form
2. Form collects customer data
3. Data flows to parent state
4. Speculation happens with whatever data is available
5. User completes form
6. Final submit includes all required fields
7. Booking succeeds

### What Didn't Change
- **No pricing logic modified** - discounts, line items, fees all unchanged
- **No validation loosened** - form still requires all fields before submit
- **No Stripe changes** - payment processing flow unchanged
- **No transaction process changes** - booking workflow unchanged

### What's Better Now
- ✅ Page renders immediately (better UX)
- ✅ Form collects data as expected (fixes the bug)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging (easier debugging)
- ✅ Backwards compatible API (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Stable breakdown/dates (better reliability)

## 🎉 Success Metrics

After this fix deploys, you should see:
- ✅ 0% "Cannot render" errors on checkout page
- ✅ 100% booking completion rate (when all fields filled)
- ✅ No customer support tickets about disabled checkout
- ✅ Clean presence check logs showing all fields `true` on submit

---

## 🤝 Rollback Plan (if needed)

If something goes wrong after deploy:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Selective Rollback
Only rollback the early-return removal:
```bash
# Edit CheckoutPageWithPayment.js and restore the early return block
git add src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageWithPayment.js
git commit -m "revert: restore orderResult.ok early return temporarily"
git push origin main
```

**Note:** You can keep the line-items API enhancement and logging - they're safe and helpful.

After successful deploy, notify:
- [ ] Customer support team - checkout issue resolved
- [ ] QA team - test checkout flow end-to-end
- [ ] Product team - booking flow now stable
