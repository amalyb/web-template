✅ **PASS** - Baseline SHA `edd0774` confirmed in `origin/main`  
✅ **PASS** - Remote branches updated (main advanced from edd07741a to 063d7925b)

### 2. Build Verification
✅ **PASS** - `npm ci` completed successfully
- 1847 packages installed
- lockfile v3 preserved
- patch-package applied: `final-form@4.20.10`

✅ **PASS** - `npm run build` completed successfully
- Web build: 419.89 kB main bundle (gzipped)
- Server build: completed
- Post-build checks: favicon guard ✅, build sanity ✅

### 3. Patch Files Available
Located in `reports/patches/`:
- ✅ `checkout-diverged.patch` (79.9 KB) - for Wave 2
- ✅ `shippo-qr-only-in-test.patch` (4.9 KB) - for Wave 4
- ✅ `server-infra-diverged.patch` (1.5 KB) - available if needed
- ✅ `transaction-core-only-in-test.patch` (49.6 KB) - available if needed

### 4. CSP & Production Headers
⚠️ **NOTE** - Production CSP verification requires manual check at production URL
- Expected: Single CSP header (report-only acceptable for monitoring)
- Action: Include CSP status note in each wave's PR body
- Reference: See `reports/reverify_csp.txt` and `reports/reverify_headers.txt` for Wave 1 verification patterns

### 5. Package Manager Verification
✅ **PASS** - Using `npm` exclusively
- No yarn.lock present
- package-lock.json using lockfile v3
- All commands use npm scripts

## Production Safety Guardrails

### Feature Flags - MUST REMAIN OFF
- ❌ `REACT_APP_CHECKOUT_ADDR_ENABLED` - Wave 2 (checkout UI)
- ❌ `SMS_ENABLED` or keep `SMS_DRY_RUN=true` - Wave 3 (SMS)
- ❌ `SHIPPO_MODE` must be `test` - Wave 4 (Shippo)

### Critical Requirements
1. ✅ All waves branch from `main` (not from w1 branch)
2. ✅ Each wave gets independent release branch
3. ✅ Build must pass before any push
4. ✅ No production flag changes in code commits
5. ✅ Environment-only feature toggles

## Ready for Wave Execution

**Status:** ✅ **CLEARED FOR WAVES 2-4**

The codebase is stable, builds successfully, and all patch files are present. Each wave will:
1. Branch from latest `main`
2. Apply appropriate patches
3. Validate builds
4. Document smoke tests
5. Generate PR artifacts
6. Push to remote for review
