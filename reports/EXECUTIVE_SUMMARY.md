# Delta Inventory: Executive Summary
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Branches:** `main` (production) vs `test` (staging)

## üéØ Bottom Line

**135 files** have changes between `main` and `test`:
- ‚úÖ **64 files** already deployed to main (content identical)
- üÜï **45 files** only in test (pending deployment)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **23 files** diverged (conflict risk - modified in both branches)
- üóëÔ∏è **3 files** deleted

## üìä Commit Divergence

| Branch | Unique Commits | Note |
|--------|----------------|------|
| `test` (not in `main`) | 125 commits | Work staged for deployment |
| `main` (not in `test`) | 7,582 commits | Main has advanced significantly via PRs |

**Analysis:** Main has received substantial updates via feature branch PRs (#8-#37), including `wave3-sms-shippo`, `wave4-gates`, and infrastructure improvements. Test branch contains 125 commits of integrated work that needs structured deployment.

## üîë Key Feature Bundles Pending

### High Priority (Only in Test - Ready for PR)

1. **SMS System Documentation** (5 files)
   - Implementation guides, investigation summaries
   - Action: Can deploy immediately (docs only)

2. **Server Transaction Enhancements** (4 files)
   - `transaction-line-items.js` changes
   - Backup/fixed versions of transition-privileged
   - Action: Review and create PR

3. **Server Utilities** (2 files)
   - Integration SDK zip, sendSMS backup
   - Action: Clean up zips, verify necessity

### Critical (Diverged - Needs Conflict Resolution)

1. **Checkout Flow** (2 files)
   - `CheckoutPageWithPayment.js` - modified in both branches
   - `StripePaymentForm.js` - modified in both branches
   - Action: Manual merge, resolve conflicts, test Stripe integration

2. **Server Infrastructure** (4 files)
   - `server/index.js` - SSR/boot changes diverged
   - `transition-privileged.js` - business logic diverged
   - `package.json` - dependency conflicts
   - Action: Careful merge, verify all env flags and SSR

3. **Build Assets** (7 files)
   - `package-lock.json`, favicon images, `public/index.html`
   - Action: Regenerate lock file, reconcile asset versions

## üö¶ Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Low-Risk (Immediate)
- [ ] Deploy documentation files (SHIPPO_ENV_SETUP.md, SMS_*.md)
- [ ] Verify already-deployed features are active in production

### Phase 2: Server Core (Week 1)
- [ ] Resolve `transition-privileged.js` conflicts
- [ ] Merge transaction-line-items updates
- [ ] Deploy server scripts (reminder scripts)
- [ ] Test: SMS flows, Shippo webhooks, QR endpoints

### Phase 3: Client & Infra (Week 2)
- [ ] Resolve checkout divergence
- [ ] Test: Full booking flow, Stripe payments, address forms
- [ ] Resolve server/index.js SSR conflicts
- [ ] Deploy with coordinated server-client release

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove .zip backup files
- [ ] Remove test-*.js debug scripts
- [ ] Sync test branch with main after deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Areas

1. **`transition-privileged.js`** - Core transaction logic modified in both branches
   - Test has: SMS integration, ship-by calculations, PD handling
   - Main has: Wave4 gates, lead days, env validation
   - Risk: Breaking transaction flow, lost bookings
   - Mitigation: Manual merge, extensive testing, feature flags

2. **`CheckoutPageWithPayment.js`** - Checkout UI diverged
   - Test has: Address persistence, form validation, env flag fixes
   - Main has: Centralized envFlags, de-duplication
   - Risk: Payment failures, UX regression
   - Mitigation: Merge with care, test Stripe test mode, verify address submission

3. **`server/index.js`** - SSR and boot sequence
   - Test has: Enhanced data loading, ChunkExtractor, boot logging
   - Main has: Standard SSR flow
   - Risk: Blank pages, bundle injection failures
   - Mitigation: Test SSR locally, verify CSS/JS injection, check nonces

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment
- [ ] Document all new ENV vars (SHIPPO_*, SMS_*, REDIS_*, QR_*)
- [ ] Update `.env.example`
- [ ] Verify Render environment config

### Testing
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Stripe test mode checkout works
- [ ] Twilio/Shippo in DRY_RUN mode
- [ ] CSP headers don't block resources

### Security
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] API endpoints have auth
- [ ] Webhook signatures verified
- [ ] Input validation on forms

### Smoke Tests
- [ ] Create listing ‚Üí Book ‚Üí Accept ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Return (full flow)
- [ ] SMS notifications sent (if enabled)
- [ ] Shippo labels generated (if enabled)
- [ ] Address forms work in checkout
- [ ] Calendar availability displays correctly

## ü§î Open Questions

1. What is the actual production Render commit SHA?
   - *Assumption: main HEAD = `edd07741a`*
   - *Action: Verify in Render dashboard*

2. Are there open PRs targeting `main` from `test`?
   - *Action: Check GitHub PR list*

3. What's the deployment timeline/priority?
   - *Action: Align with product roadmap*

4. Should test branch be rebased on main before PR?
   - *Pro: Clean history, fewer conflicts*
   - *Con: Rewrites 125 commits*
   - *Recommendation: Merge main ‚Üí test, resolve conflicts, then PR*

## üë• Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Review this summary with team
2. Identify production commit SHA
3. Prioritize feature bundles

**This Week:**
1. Create PRs for low-risk bundles
2. Begin conflict resolution on diverged files
3. Set up staging environment for testing

**Next Week:**
1. Deploy server changes with feature flags
2. Deploy client changes after server is stable
3. Monitor production metrics
