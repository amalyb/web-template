CSP HEADER ANALYSIS
===================

Headers found:
- content-security-policy-report-only: YES (1 occurrence)
- content-security-policy: NO (0 occurrences)

VERDICT: PASS âœ“

Status: Exactly ONE CSP family header found (report-only mode).
This is acceptable for Wave-0 baseline. The site is using CSP in report-only mode,
which means violations are logged but not enforced.

Note: If the intention is to enforce CSP (blocking mode), the header name should be
changed from "content-security-policy-report-only" to "content-security-policy".
