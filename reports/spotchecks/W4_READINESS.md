# Wave 4 - Shippo Integration - Merge Readiness Report

**Branch:** `release/w4-shippo`  
**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Reviewer:** QA Engineer (Automated)

---

## Summary
Wave 4 implements Shippo shipping label generation and tracking webhook integration. The implementation includes shipping date calculations, webhook signature verification, and phone number normalization for SMS notifications.

---

## Check Results

### A) computeShipByDate Signature Consistency - PASS
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Files checked:**
- `reports/spotchecks/w4_signature.txt` - Function signature
- `reports/spotchecks/w4_calls.txt` - All call sites

**Findings:**
✅ **Function signature** (`server/lib/shipping.js:13`):
```javascript
function computeShipByDate(tx) {
```
Takes a transaction object (`tx`) as parameter.

✅ **Call sites verified** (2 locations):
1. `server/api/transition-privileged.js:352`:
   ```javascript
   const shipByDate = computeShipByDate(transaction);
   ```
   ✓ Passes transaction object

2. `server/scripts/sendShipByReminders.js:131`:
   ```javascript
   const shipByDate = computeShipByDate(tx);
   ```
   ✓ Passes transaction object

✅ **Internal consistency** (`server/lib/shipping.js:15`):
```javascript
const startISO = getBookingStartISO(tx);
```
- Uses `getBookingStartISO(tx)` helper internally
- Helper extracts booking start from transaction object
- No legacy `{ bookingStartISO }` object callers remain

✅ **Module exports** (`server/lib/shipping.js:41`):
```javascript
module.exports = { computeShipByDate, formatShipBy, getBookingStartISO };
```

**Verdict:** Signature is consistent across all call sites. No legacy patterns detected.

### B) Webhook Presence/Hardening - PASS
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**File checked:** `reports/spotchecks/w4_webhooks.txt`

**Findings:**
✅ **Webhook handler exists**: `server/webhooks/shippoTracking.js`

✅ **Route configuration** (line 42, 192):
```javascript
router.use('/shippo', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), ...);
router.post('/shippo', async (req, res) => { ... });
```

✅ **Signature verification** (lines 198-206):
- Production: Checks `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and verifies signature
- Dev/Test: Logs warning but allows requests through
- Proper error handling for missing/invalid signatures

✅ **Success path references**:
- Line 316: Tracking URL construction (`https://track.shippo.com/...`)
- Line 324: Transition for first scan (`webhook/shippo-return-first-scan`)
- Line 437: Dynamic transition for various SMS types (`webhook/shippo-${smsType}`)

✅ **Security**:
- Raw body parser for signature verification
- Production mode enforces signature validation
- Test mode allows bypass with warning

**Verdict:** Webhook handler is present, hardened, and references success paths.

---

### C) Build - PASS
**Status:** ✅ PASS

**File:** `reports/spotchecks/w4_build.txt`

**Steps:**
1. `npm ci` - Successful (1847 packages installed)
2. `npm run build` - Successful

**Verdict:** Build completes successfully.

---

### D) Environment Checklist
**File:** `reports/spotchecks/W4_ENV_CHECKLIST.md`

Created comprehensive checklist with:
- `SHIPPO_MODE=test` (critical for staging)
- `SHIPPO_API_TOKEN` (staging test token)
- `SHIP_LEAD_DAYS=2` (shipping lead time)
- `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (webhook signature verification)

See file for detailed deployment verification steps.

---

## Final Verdict

### ✅ MERGE READY: YES

All critical checks (A, B, C) passed:
- ✅ computeShipByDate signature is consistent (takes tx object)
- ✅ Shippo webhook handler present with hardening
- ✅ Build successful

**Notes for Deployment:**
1. **Critical**: Set `SHIPPO_MODE=test` on staging (prevents real label creation)
2. Set `SHIPPO_API_TOKEN` with test token from Shippo dashboard
3. Set `SHIP_LEAD_DAYS=2` (or desired lead time)
4. Set `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for webhook signature verification
5. Verify webhook endpoint `/webhooks/shippo` is accessible
6. Test label creation and tracking updates in Shippo test mode

**Code Quality Observations:**
- Clean function signature (no legacy patterns)
- Proper webhook security with signature verification
- Graceful degradation for dev/test environments
- Phone normalization for SMS notifications integrated
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Production Readiness:**
- ⚠️ DO NOT use `SHIPPO_MODE=live` until fully tested in staging
- Monitor Shippo usage/costs when in live mode
- Ensure `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in production

---

## Remediation Required
None.

## Additional Notes
The Shippo integration is well-structured with:
- Clear separation of test/live modes
- Webhook security for production
- Proper date calculations using transaction objects
- SMS notification integration for tracking updates
