## Commit Message (detailed)

```
fix(checkout): resolve TDZ error, add orderParams validation, prevent re-initiation loop

Fixes critical Temporal Dead Zone error in CheckoutPageWithPayment that caused
app crash: "Cannot access 'it' before initialization at line ~758"

Changes:
- Extract onInitiatePrivilegedSpeculativeTransaction before useEffect to avoid TDZ
  * Changed from destructuring to direct property access (line 784)
  * Updated dependency array to use specific callback instead of 'props' (line 820)
  * Prevents minifier from creating circular reference with intermediate variable

- Add orderParams validation guard to prevent invalid Stripe mounting
  * Early return when orderResult.ok is false (line 963)
  * Shows user-friendly error for incomplete booking data
  * Prevents initiation with undefined bookingDates

- Safe destructuring in debug logs
  * Added || {} fallback for orderResult.params (line 811)
  * Prevents crashes when logging with null params

Testing:
- Build successful: CheckoutPage bundle 12.01 kB (+61 B)
- No TDZ errors in compiled output
- All code structure checks pass:
  ✓ Helper functions at top (line 72)
  ✓ Refs before useEffect (line 694)  
  ✓ Callback extracted before useEffect (line 784)
  ✓ OrderParams validation (line 963)
  ✓ Stable dependencies (line 820)

Resolves: 
- TDZ runtime error
- Invalid bookingDates causing API errors
- Multiple initiate-privileged calls
- Request/re-render loops

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## Deployment Notes

After merging to main:
1. Build will automatically trigger on Render
2. Monitor production logs for:
   - No TDZ errors in console
   - Single initiate-privileged call per checkout session
   - No AVIF request floods
   - Successful Stripe Element mounting
3. Verify checkout completion rate in analytics

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```bash
# Revert this commit
git revert HEAD

# Or reset to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

The previous version is stable and can be restored immediately.
