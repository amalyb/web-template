# Short SMS Links - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Generate Secret (30 seconds)
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Copy the output.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables (2 minutes)

In Render dashboard (or your deployment platform):

```bash
LINK_SECRET=<paste-output-from-step-1>
APP_HOST=https://web-template-1.onrender.com
```

### Step 3: Deploy (2 minutes)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add short SMS links to fix Twilio 30019 errors"
git push origin test
```

### Step 4: Verify (30 seconds)
```bash
# Test redirect works
curl -I https://your-host.com/r/test123
# Should return 400 (expected - link doesn't exist yet)

# Trigger a test booking acceptance
# Check lender SMS - should see short links
```

---

## üìã Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] `LINK_SECRET` is set (32+ chars)
- [ ] `APP_HOST` is set to your domain
- [ ] `REDIS_URL` is already configured (existing)
- [ ] Code deployed to test environment
- [ ] `/r/:t` route is accessible

## üß™ Quick Test

### 1. Test Short Link Generation
```bash
cd /Users/amaliabornstein/shop-on-sherbet-cursor
node -e "
const { shortLink } = require('./server/api-util/shortlink');
(async () => {
  const url = 'https://shippo.com/label/test123';
  const short = await shortLink(url);
  console.log('Original:', url.length, 'chars');
  console.log('Short:', short.length, 'chars');
  console.log('Link:', short);
})();
"
```

### 2. Test SMS Length
```bash
node test-sms-length.js
# Should see: ‚úÖ All SMS length tests passed!
```

### 3. Test in Production
1. Go to test environment
2. Create a booking
3. Accept as lender
4. Check SMS - should see short link
5. Click link - should redirect to Shippo

## üîç Monitoring

### Check Short Links in Redis
```bash
# List all short links
redis-cli KEYS "shortlink:*"

# Check specific link
redis-cli GET "shortlink:aB3xY9"

# Check TTL (seconds remaining)
redis-cli TTL "shortlink:aB3xY9"
```

### Check Logs
```bash
# Look for these patterns:
grep "SHORTLINK" logs.txt
grep "SMS\]\[Step-3\]" logs.txt

# Success pattern:
[SHORTLINK] Generated token for URL
[SMS][Step-3] strategy=app link=https://sherbrt.com/r/...
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### SMS still too long?
```bash
# Check if LINK_SECRET is set
echo $LINK_SECRET

# Check logs for fallback warning
grep "LINK_SECRET not set" logs.txt
```

### Redirect not working?
```bash
# Verify route is registered
curl https://your-host.com/r/invalid123
# Should return 400 "Invalid link" (means route works)
```

### Redis errors?
```bash
# Check Redis connection
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

---

## üìä Success Indicators

‚úÖ SMS length < 150 chars  
‚úÖ No Twilio 30019 errors  
‚úÖ Short links redirect correctly  
‚úÖ Redis keys created with `shortlink:*` prefix  
‚úÖ Logs show `[SHORTLINK]` messages  

---

## üîÑ Rollback (if needed)

```bash
# Quick fix - use original URLs
# Edit transition-privileged.js line 447:
const shortQr = qrUrl;  # Instead of: await shortLink(qrUrl)

# Or full rollback:
git revert HEAD
git push origin test
```
