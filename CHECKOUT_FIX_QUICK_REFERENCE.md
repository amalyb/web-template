# Checkout Fix - Quick Reference Card

## What Was Fixed

Submit button stuck disabled after speculation → **FIXED**

## The Critical Missing Piece

After speculation succeeds, we needed to call `retrievePaymentIntent()` to bridge the gap:

```
Speculation → clientSecret → retrievePaymentIntent() → PaymentIntent → Stripe mounts
```

## Files Changed

1. `src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPage.duck.js` - Store clientSecret
2. `src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPageWithPayment.js` - **Call retrievePaymentIntent** + fix gates
3. `src/containers/CheckoutPage/CheckoutPage.js` - Pass new props

## Must-See Console Logs

```
[POST-SPECULATE] { clientSecretPresent: true }
[STRIPE] Retrieving PaymentIntent with clientSecret    ← Must see!
[STRIPE] PaymentIntent retrieved successfully          ← Must see!
[Stripe] element mounted: true
[SUBMIT_GATES] { canSubmit: true }
```

**If missing steps 2-3:** The critical bridge isn't working!

## Quick Test

1. Open console (F12)
2. Go to listing → select dates → "Request to book"
3. Watch for the 5 logs above in order
4. Fill payment details
5. Verify button enables
6. Submit successfully

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No `[STRIPE] Retrieving...` | Effect not firing | Verify stripe & clientSecret props exist |
| No `[Stripe] element mounted` | PaymentIntent not retrieved | Check network tab for Stripe API errors |
| `canSubmit: false` forever | Check which gate is false | Look at `[SUBMIT_GATES]` disabledReason |
| Button says "noSpeculativeTx" | Speculation didn't succeed | Check `[INITIATE_TX] success` log |

## Redux State to Verify

```javascript
state.CheckoutPage: {
  speculativeTransactionId: { uuid: '...' },  // Must have value
  stripeClientSecret: 'pi_..._secret_...',    // Must have value
  speculateStatus: 'succeeded'                // Must be 'succeeded'
}

state.stripe: {
  paymentIntent: { /* full object */ }        // Must have value (after retrievePaymentIntent)
}
```

## Gate Logic (Correct)

```javascript
const canSubmit = 
  hasSpeculativeTx &&   // ✅ Must be TRUE (not inverted!)
  stripeReady &&        // ✅ Must be TRUE
  formValid &&          // ✅ Must be TRUE
  !submitting;          // ✅ Must be FALSE
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

```bash
git checkout src/containers/CheckoutPage/*.js
```

## Success = All These True

- [x] Console shows all 5 logs in order
- [x] Redux has speculativeTransactionId
- [x] Redux has stripeClientSecret  
- [x] Redux has paymentIntent (in stripe state)
- [x] Button enables after form filled
- [x] Transaction submits successfully

## The Key Insight (Thanks to Feedback!)

StripePaymentForm needs the **full PaymentIntent object** from `state.stripe.paymentIntent`, not just a client secret string. The missing bridge was calling `retrievePaymentIntent()` to fetch that object using the client secret we got from speculation.
