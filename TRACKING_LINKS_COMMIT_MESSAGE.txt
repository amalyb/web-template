feat: Add carrier-aware short tracking links for SMS messages

Replace long Shippo tracking URLs with short public carrier tracking links
(UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL) in SMS messages to improve user experience and
reduce SMS character count.

Changes:
- Created server/lib/trackingLinks.js with getPublicTrackingUrl() function
  that generates short public carrier tracking URLs based on carrier type
- Updated server/webhooks/shippoTracking.js to use public carrier URLs
  for Step 4 (item shipped) and Step 10 (return in transit) SMS notifications
- Added [TRACKINGLINK] logging to verify which carrier links are being used

Benefits:
- Shorter SMS messages (carrier URLs are ~50% shorter than Shippo URLs)
- Better user experience (recipients recognize official carrier tracking pages)
- More reliable (direct carrier URLs don't depend on third-party services)
- Cost savings (shorter messages may reduce SMS costs)

Supported carriers:
- USPS: https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input?origTrackNum=...
- UPS: https://www.ups.com/track?loc=en_US&tracknum=...
- FedEx: https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?tracknumbers=...
- DHL: https://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html?AWB=...
- Fallback: https://goshippo.com/track/... (for unknown carriers)

Files modified:
- server/lib/trackingLinks.js (new)
- server/webhooks/shippoTracking.js (updated)

Testing:
- All unit tests pass (8/8)
- No linter errors
- Backward compatible (falls back to Shippo for unknown carriers)
