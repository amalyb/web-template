## 📋 Summary of Findings

| Question | Answer | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Why does BookingDatesForm receive unitPrice as a string?** | 🔴 **SSR Hydration Issue** | Money instances lost during JSON serialization. See `analysis/MONEY_STRING_SEARCH.md` |
| **Is Money being stringified upstream?** | 🟡 **Not in production code** | Debug helpers stringify for logging only. Real issue is hydration. |
| **Is there a TDZ issue at line 730?** | ✅ **NO** | All code properly ordered. See `analysis/TDZ_CHECK.md` |
| **Are 401s caused by premature privileged calls?** | ✅ **NO** | 4 layers of auth guards prevent this. See `analysis/AUTH_GUARD_CHECK.md` |

### Test Harnesses (3 files)

   - Captures unitPrice prop type without runtime logs
   - Tests: Money instance vs string detection
   - Run: `npm test -- BookingDatesForm.props.spec.js`

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Confirm the Diagnosis
```bash
# Run the test harnesses to verify Money stringification issue exists
npm test -- BookingDatesForm.props.spec.js
npm test -- selectors.money.spec.js
```

**Expected Result:**
- If tests **FAIL**: Money stringification bug confirmed → Proceed to Step 2
- If tests **PASS**: Money instances preserved correctly → No fix needed (issue resolved elsewhere)

### 2. Implement the Fix (if tests fail)

**File to edit:** `src/store.js`

**What to add:** `reviveMoneyInstances()` function (see `analysis/ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY.md` for full code)

**Summary:**
```javascript
// After state is hydrated from window.__PRELOADED_STATE__,
// re-instantiate Money class instances that were lost during JSON serialization

const preloadedState = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.__PRELOADED_STATE__
  ? reviveMoneyInstances(window.__PRELOADED_STATE__)  // ← Add this
  : undefined;
```

**Full implementation:** See `analysis/ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY.md` → "Fix 1: Money Hydration"

### 3. Test the Fix
```bash
# Both should now pass
npm test -- BookingDatesForm.props.spec.js
npm test -- selectors.money.spec.js

# Auth guards should still pass
npm test -- auth-guard.spec.js
```

### 4. Optional: Add Defensive Code
If you want belt-and-suspenders protection, add `normalizeMoneyProp` to BookingDatesForm (see ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY.md → "Option 2")

## 📊 Issue Status Matrix

| Issue | Current Status | Root Cause | Action Required |
|-------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Money as String** | 🔴 Needs Fix | SSR hydration loses Money instances | YES - Implement `reviveMoneyInstances` in store.js |
| **TDZ Error** | ✅ No Issue | False alarm or fixed in previous commit | NO - Code is correct |
| **401 Errors** | ✅ No Issue | Auth guards properly implemented | NO - Guards working correctly |

## 🔍 Key Insights

### What We Found

1. **Money Stringification:**
   - NOT caused by production code stringifying Money
   - NOT caused by sanitizers or selectors
   - **Likely caused by:** SSR serialization (`JSON.stringify`) losing Money class instances
   - **Evidence:** Debug helpers in BookingDatesForm.js convert Money to string ONLY for logging

2. **TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone):**
   - All imports at top of file ✅
   - All helper functions use hoisted `function` declarations ✅
   - All `useMemo`/`useCallback` dependencies declared before use ✅
   - **No TDZ issues detected**

3. **401 Unauthorized:**
   - 4-layer auth guard system prevents unauthenticated calls ✅
   - Component checks `currentUser?.id` before calling thunk ✅
   - Thunk checks `currentUser?.id` again before API call ✅
   - Token presence verified in localStorage ✅
   - **Auth guards working correctly**

### What the Tests Do

All tests use **mocking and assertions**, NOT runtime console logs:

- **Props test:** Mocks BookingDatesForm to capture props, asserts Money instance type
- **Selector test:** Creates mock Redux state, asserts Money preserved through selectors
- **Auth guard test:** Creates mock store, asserts API not called when unauthenticated

## 🚀 Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read `analysis/ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Run `npm test -- BookingDatesForm.props.spec.js` to confirm issue
- [ ] If test fails: Implement `reviveMoneyInstances` in `src/store.js`
- [ ] Re-run tests to verify fix
- [ ] Optional: Add defensive `normalizeMoneyProp` to BookingDatesForm
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Monitor for Money-related errors in browser console
- [ ] Verify 401 errors don't increase

## 🛠️ Debugging Tips

### If tests fail to run
```bash
# Make sure jest is configured
npm test -- --listTests

# Run specific test with verbose output
npm test -- BookingDatesForm.props.spec.js --verbose
```

### If Money stringification still occurs after fix
1. Check server-side rendering code (`server/ssr.js` or `server/renderer.js`)
2. Verify `reviveMoneyInstances` is actually called (add `console.log`)
3. Check if there are multiple hydration points in the app
4. Verify SDK is importing Money correctly (`import { types as sdkTypes } from './util/sdkLoader'`)

### If 401 errors still occur
1. Check backend logs for token validation failures
2. Verify `isClockInSync` prop is true (clock skew check)
3. Check token expiration settings (should be >= 1 hour)
4. Look for race conditions in logout flow

## 📞 Questions Answered

### "Is the issue in production code or just debug logs?"
**Answer:** Debug logs in BookingDatesForm.js stringify Money (lines 327-338), but only for console.log. The real issue is SSR hydration losing Money instances before they reach components.

### "Should I remove the debug logs from BookingDatesForm.js?"
**Answer:** Optional. They're harmless (only log, don't affect props), but you can remove them after confirming the fix works.

### "Do I need to fix the TDZ issue?"
**Answer:** No. No TDZ issue exists. Code is correctly structured.

### "Are the auth guards causing 401s?"
**Answer:** No. Auth guards PREVENT 401s by checking authentication before API calls. They're working correctly.

### "Which fix should I implement first?"
**Answer:** Only the Money hydration fix is needed. See `ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY.md` → "Fix 1: Money Hydration (CRITICAL)".
